Put lhmAutos = new LinkedHashMapAutos(); from the default constructor of ProxyAutomobile into buildAuto() method.
Therefore, there would not be null pointer error when we instantiate EditOptionInter object to modify the static object
LHMAutos, because lhmAutos = new LinkedHashMapAutos(); will be called again when EditOptionInter object is declared when
it is in the default constructor of ProxyAutomobile.

1.1
Create a new method called initializeLHMAuto() and put it in ModifyLHMAuto interface.
Call it only once in the whole program.
